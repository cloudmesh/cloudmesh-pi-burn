## Recommendations:

3. Old hackaday,opensource, and medium tutorials can be deleted or modified with a note at the top pointing them to the three up-to-date pi-planet tutorials:
       https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/tutorial/raspberry-burn/ (linux,mac)
       https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/tutorial/ubuntu-burn/ (linux, max)
       https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/tutorial/raspberry-burn-windows/ (windows)
       
NOTE: This tutorial has been superseded by new updates. Please see our updated tutorials at:

- https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/tutorial/raspberry-burn/ (burn a raspberry cluster from linux or mac)

- https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/tutorial/ubuntu-burn/ (burn an ubuntu cluster from linux or mac)
    
- https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/tutorial/raspberry-burn-windows/ (burn a raspberry cluster from windows)

       
4. Replace most of the out-of-date pi-burn Github README with links to the up-to-date pi-planet tutorials. https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-pi-burn/blob/main/README.md 

## Working Pi Burning Tutorials:

Burning a set of pre-configured Raspberry OS cards for Raspberry Pis with Wifi Access

- https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/tutorial/raspberry-burn/

Burning a set of Ubuntu Server Cards for Raspberry Pis with Internet Access

- https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/tutorial/ubuntu-burn/

DRAFT: Burning a pre-configured RaspberryOS Cluster on Windows 10

- https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/tutorial/raspberry-burn-windows/
- NOTE: Works for raspi OS only

Burning a set of pre-configured SD cards with a GUI for Raspberry Pis with Wifi Access

- https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/tutorial/gui-burn/
- NOTE: Based only on code inspection I expect this to still work, or be easiyly fixed.
