  To create a cluster from Rasberry Pi's one needs to either use a
  headless setup or burn a number of SDC cards. Typically after the
  burning of SDCards we are faced with additional setup steps. HOwever
  these steps can be simplified while asuring that the SDCard is
  modified after the burning with ssh enabeled, a public key injected,
  a unique hostname assigned, and a network address specified. THis
  command is naturally also important in case we need to reburn a card
  in case a card would become bad or the OS on it for some reason
  coccupteed.  While attaching a multicard USB writer it is possible
  to write multiple cards easily while avoiding the cost of a card
  duplicator and minimizing the time one needs to switch cards into a
  single card writer.
