## 1. Introduction

`cms burn` is a program to burn many SD cards for the preparation of
building clusters with Raspberry Pi's. It allows users to create
readily bootable SD cards that have the network configured and contain a
public ssh key from your machine that you then use to login into the
PIs after boot. Thus, little setup is needed for a cluster after boot. Another
unique feature is that you can burn multiple cards in a row, each with
their individual setup such as hostnames and ipadresses.


## 2. Nomenclature

* Commands proceeded with `pi@managerpi:$` are to be executed on the
  Raspberry Pi with the name `managerpi`.

* Commands with `(ENV3) pi@managerpi:$` are to be executed in a virtual ENV
  using Python 3 on the Raspberry Pi with the name managerpi
  
## 3. Quickstarts

We provide the following quickstarts:

1. [Quickstart to burn worker SD Cards on a PI via an inventory](#72-quickstart-for-using-a-pi-to-burn-a-cluster-using-inventory)
2. [Quickstart to burn all cards on  macOS or Linux vi the cluster command](#71-quickstart-for-a-setup-of-a-cluster-from-macos-or-linux-with-no-burning-on-a-pi)
   
   On macOS this requires you have write access for ext4 which requires the
   purchase of additional software. If you do not lke to do this see the
   solution discussed in 1.
  
However before you do the Quickstarts we encourage you to look at other 
features we provide.   

## 4. Setup for Bridged WiFi

To provide you with a glimpse of what you can do with cms burn, we
have provided this quickstart guide that will create one manager PI and
several workers.

This setup is intended for those who have restricted access to their
network (ie. cannot access router controls).  For example, those
on campus WiFis or regulated apartment WiFis.

Figure 1 describes our network configuration. We have 5
Raspberry Pi 4s: 1 manager and 4 workers. We have WiFi access, but we
do not necessarily have wired access or access to the router's controls.

We also have a network switch, where the manager and workers can
communicate locally, but we will configure the manager to provide
internet access to devices on the network switch via a "network
bridge".

Figure 1: Pi Cluster setup with bridge network

### 4.1 Requirements

For the quickstart we have the following hardware requirements:

* SD Cards and Raspberry Pis

* You will need an SD card reader/writer (USB-A) to burn new cards. We
  recommend that you buy a USB 3.0 SDCard reader/writer as they are
  significantly faster and you can reuse them on PI'4s. Make sure to
  get an adapter if your normal computer only supports USB-C
  
* You will need a Raspberry Pi cluster. Detailed information about
  parts are provided at our
  [Web page](https://cloudmesh.github.io/pi/docs/hardware/parts/).

### 4.2 Manager Pi

First we need to configure the Manager Pi

**Step 0.** Burn Manager Pi SD Card

Using [Raspberry Pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/),
  burn an SD card with *Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) with desktop and
  recommended applications*. You may use your normal system to burn
  such a card including Windows, macOS, or Linux.

You will then want a method of accessing this manager Pi. You may
either use SSH (recommended) from the command line or a monitor to use the desktop environment (easiest)
to access it. We highly recommend
[changing the password](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/users.md)
on the Pi as soon as you have access. This is because the pi is
initialized with default user `pi` and default password
`raspberry`. This is critical if you are on a shared network where
anyone can attempt to access your pi.

> Monitor Desktop Environment: You will need a monitor, keyboard, and
> mouse. This is the easiest approach as Raspberry Pi OS provides a
> very nice user interface with an easy-to-follow setup process for
> connecting to WiFi and other such tasks.

> SSH Environment: You may consider enabling SSH access to your Pi so
> that you may access the file system from your preferred machine.

> Headless Configuration: See section 3 of
> [enabling ssh](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/)
> for instructions on how to enable SSH headlessly. Similarly,
> [how to enable WiFi headlessly](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/10251/prepare-sd-card-for-wifi-on-headless-pi).
> Additionally you can check out the FAQ for step-by-step
> instructions.
> [Using Pi Imager to setup a Manager Pi with headless access](#using-pi-imager-to-setup-a-manager-pi-with-headless-access).

> Update the firmware: See the FAQ [How to update firmware?](#712-how-to-update-firmware)

**Step 1.** Installing Cloudmesh on the Manager Pi

Open a new terminal screen on the Manager Pi. Here we assume the
hostname is `managerpi`. However, this is of no importance in relation
to the topics of this guide.

Update pip. The simple curl command below will generate an ssh-key,
update your system, and install cloudmesh.

```
pi@managerpi:~ $ pip install pip -U
pi@managerpi:~ $ curl -Ls http://cloudmesh.github.io/get/pi | sh -                
```

This will take a moment...

**Step 2.** Reboot

The installation script updates your system. Reboot for effect.

```
pi@managerpi:~ $ sudo reboot
```

**Step 3.** Download the latest Raspberry Pi Lite OS

The following command will download the latest images for Raspberry
Lite OS.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms burn image get latest-lite
```

We can verify our image's downloaded with the following.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms burn image ls
```

> **Note.** For our cluster we use light, but if you like 
> to use other versions please see this note.
> We can use the following command to list the current
> Raspberry Pi OS versions (full and lite)
>
> ```
> (ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms burn image versions --refresh
> ```
>
> This will list the Tags and Types of each available OS. We can then
> modify the `image get` command for versions we are interested in. For
> example,
>
> ```
> (ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms burn image get full-2020-05-28
> ```


**Step 4**. Setup SD Card Writer

Plug your SD Card Writer into the Pi. Ensure you have an SD Card
inserted into your writer. Run the following command to find the path
to your SD Card.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms burn info
...
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# SD Cards Found
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

+----------+----------------------+----------+-----------+-------+------------------+---------+-----------+-----------+
| Path     | Info                 | Readable | Formatted | Empty | Size             | Aaccess | Removable | Writeable |
+----------+----------------------+----------+-----------+-------+------------------+---------+-----------+-----------+
| /dev/sda | Generic Mass-Storage | True     | True      | False | 64.1 GB/59.7 GiB | True    | True      |           |
+----------+----------------------+----------+-----------+-------+------------------+---------+-----------+-----------+
```

> `cms burn info` has other useful information, but for the purposes
> of this guide we omit it.

We can see from the information displayed that our SD card's path is
`/dev/sda`. Of course, this may vary. 

### 4.3 Burning Multiple SD Cards with a Single Burner

**Step 0.** Ensure the first SD card is inserted into the burner.

We can run `cms burn info` again as we did above to verify our SD 
Card is connected.

**Step 1.** Burning the Cards

`cms burn` supports parameterized hostnames that allow automatic incrementation
of numbers.

For example, `red00[1-2]` is interpreted by cms burn as `[red001, red002]`.
Similarly, `red[a-c]` is interpreted by cms burn as `[reda, redb, redc]`.

We can burn 2 SD cards as follows:

**!! WARNING VERIFY THE DEVICE IS CORRECT. REFER TO CMS BURN !!**

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms burn create --hostname=red00[1-4] --ip=10.1.1.[2-5] --device=/dev/sda --tag=latest-lite
```

The user will be prompted to swap the SD cards after each card burn if 
there are still remaining cards to burn.

**Step 2.** Boot the cluster

After all cards are burned. Turn off the cluster, insert the cards, and turn 
the cluster back on.

We can now proceed to the next section where we configure our bridge.

### 4.4 Connecting Pis to the Internet via Bridge

Figure 1 depicts how the network is set up with the help of the bridge
command.

![](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-pi-burn/raw/main/images/network-bridge.png)

Figure 1: Networking Bridge

**Step 0.** Review and Setup

At this point, we assume that you have used `cms burn` to create all SD
cards for the Pi's with static IP addresses in the subnet range
`10.1.1.0/24` (excluding `10.1.1.1`. See step 1 for details)

We are also continuing to use `managerpi` (which is where we burn the
worker SD cards).

We will now use `cms bridge` to connect the worker Pis to the
internet. Let us again reference the diagram of our network setup. You
should now begin connecting your Pis via the network switch
(unmanaged or managed) if you have not done so already. Ensure that
`managerpi` is also connected to the network switch.

We assign the eth0 interface of the `managerpi` to be 10.1.1.1, and it 
acts as the default gateway for the workers. The workers' IPs were set 
during the create command.

**Step 1.** Configuring our Bridge

We can easily create our bridge as follows. 

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms bridge create --interface='wlan0'
```

We should now reboot.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ sudo reboot
```

> Note the `--interface` option indicates the interface used by the
> manager pi to access the internet.  In this case, since we are using
> WiFi, it is likely `wlan0`. Other options such as `eth0` and `eth1`
> exist for ethernet connections.

**Step 2.** Verifying internet connection 

We should now be able to see our workers. 

```
arp -a
```

Note it may take a few minutes for them to populate in the neighbor table. If 
you want to speed this up try to ping them individually.

```
ping red002
```

At this point, our workers should have internet access. Let us SSH
into one and ping google.com to verify. Ensure you have booted your
workers and connected them to the same network switch as the manager.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ ssh red002

pi@red002:~ $ ping google.com
PING google.com (142.250.64.238) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from mia07s57-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.64.238): icmp_seq=1 ttl=106 time=48.2 ms

5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 9ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 47.924/48.169/48.511/0.291 ms
```

Note how we are able to omit the pi user and .local extension. We have
successfully configured our bridge. Our pis are now ready to cluster.

## 5. Set up of the SSH keys and SSH tunnel

One important aspect of a cluster is to setup authentication via ssh
in a convenient way, so we can easily login from the laptop to each of
the PI workers and the PI manager. Furthermore, we like to be able to
login from the PI manager to each of the workers. In addition, we like
to be able to login between the workers.

We have chosen a very simple setup while relying on ssh tunnel.

To simplify the setup of this we have developed a command `cms host`
that gathers and scatters keys onto all machines, as well as sets up
the tunnels.

It is essential that the key on the laptop must not be password
less. This is also valid for any machine that is directly added to the
network such as in the mesh network.

To avoid password less keys we recommend you to use `ssh-add` 
or `ssh-keychain` which will ask you for one.

The manual page for `cms host` is provided in the Manual Pages
section.

**Step 1.** On the manager create ssh keys for each of the workers.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms host key create red00[1-3]
```

**Step 2.** On the manager gather the worker, manager, and your laptop
public ssh keys into a file.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms host key gather red00[1-3],you@yourlaptop.local ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Step 3.** On the manager scatter the public keys to all the workers
and manager ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts file

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms host key scatter red00[1-3],localhost ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Step 4.** Remove undeeded keys.txt file

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ rm keys.txt
```

**Step 5.** Verify SSH reachability from worker to manager and worker to worker.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ ssh red001
pi@red001:~ $ ssh managerpi.local
```

TODO: BUG: The workers still currently still need to use .local after names. This 
will be resolved by the inventory create update.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ exit
pi@red001:~ $ ssh red002.local
pi@red002:~ $ exit
pi@red001:~ $ exit
```

**Step 6.** (For Bridge setup) Create SSH tunnels on the manager 
to enable ssh access from your laptop to the workers

For now, we manually install autossh, to test the new cms host tunnel
program. Later we add it to the main manager setup script.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ yes y | sudo apt install autossh
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms host tunnel create red00[1-3]
```

**Step 7.** (For Bridge setup) Copy the specified command output to 
your `~/.ssh/config` file on your laptop

```
host tunnel create red00[1-3]

Using wlan0 IP = 192.168.1.17
Using cluster hostname = managerpi

Tunnels created.

Please place the following in your remote machine's (i.e. laptop)
`~/.ssh/config` file to alias simple ssh access (i.e. `ssh red001`).

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# copy to ~/.ssh/config on remote host (i.e laptop)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Host red001
     HostName managerpi.local
     User pi
     Port 8001

Host red002
     HostName managerpi.local
     User pi
     Port 8002

Host red003
     HostName managerpi.local
     User pi
     Port 8003
```

> Note: We will in the future provide an addition to the command so you 
> can remove and add
> them directly from the command line
> 
> ```
> cms host tunnel config create red00[1-3]
> cms host tunnel config delete red00[1-3]
> ```

**Step 8.** (For Bridge setup) Verify SSH reachability from the laptop
  to workers

```
you@yourlaptop:~ $ ssh red001
```

**Step 9.** Shutdown or reboot your entire cluster using the commands below.

```
you@yourlaptop:~ $ cms host shutdown red,red00[1-3]
```

```
you@yourlaptop:~ $ cms host reboot red,red00[1-3]
```

Note to execute the command on the commandline you have to type in
`cms bridge` and not just `bridge`.

<!--MANUAL-BRIDGE-->
```
  bridge create [--interface=INTERFACE] [--ip=IP] [--dns=NAMESERVER]

Options:
  --interface=INTERFACE  The interface name [default: eth1]
                         You can also specify wlan0 if you want
                         to bridge through WIFI on the manager
                         eth0 requires a USB to WIFI adapter

  --ip=IP  The ip address to assign on the eth0 interface,
           ie. the listening interface [default: 10.1.1.1]

  --dns=NAMESERVER  The ip address of a nameserver to set
                    statically. For example, --dns=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
                    will use the google nameservers

Description:

  Command used to set up a bride so that all nodes route the traffic
  trough the manager PI.

  bridge create [--interface=INTERFACE] [--ip=IP] [--dns=NAMESERVER]
      creates the bridge on the current device.
      A reboot is required.
```
<!--MANUAL-BRIDGE-->





### 6.3 Manual Page for the `host` command

Note to execute the command on the commandline you have to type in
`cms host` and not jsut `host`.

<!--MANUAL-HOST-->
```
    host scp NAMES SOURCE DESTINATION [--dryrun]
    host ssh NAMES COMMAND [--dryrun] [--output=FORMAT]
    host config NAMES [IPS] [--user=USER] [--key=PUBLIC]
    host check NAMES [--user=USER] [--key=PUBLIC]
    host key create NAMES [--user=USER] [--dryrun] [--output=FORMAT]
    host key list NAMES [--output=FORMAT]
    host key gather NAMES [--authorized_keys] [FILE]
    host key scatter NAMES FILE [--user=USER]
    host key add NAMES FILE
    host key delete NAMES FILE
    host tunnel create NAMES [--port=PORT]
    host mac NAMES [--eth] [--wlan] [--output=FORMAT]
    host setup WORKERS [LAPTOP]

    host reboot NAMES
    host adduser NAMES USER
    host passwd NAMES USER
    host addsudo NAMES USER
    host deluser NAMES USER
    host config proxy PROXY NAMES [--append]


This command does some useful things.

Arguments:
    FILE   a file name

Options:
    --dryrun   shows what would be done but does not execute
    --output=FORMAT  the format of the output
    --port=PORT starting local port for tunnel assignment

Description:

    host scp NAMES SOURCE DESTINATION

      TBD

    host ssh NAMES COMMAND

      runs the command on all specified hosts
      Example:
           ssh red[01-10] "uname -a"

    host key create NAMES
      create a ~/.ssh/id_rsa and id_rsa.pub on all hosts specified
      Example:
          ssh key create "red[01-10]"

    host key list NAMES

      list all id_rsa.pub keys from all hosts specifed
       Example:
           ssh key list red[01-10]

    host key gather HOSTS FILE

      gathers all keys from file FILE including the one from localhost.

          ssh key gather "red[01-10]" keys.txt

    host key scatter HOSTS FILE [--user=USER]

      copies all keys from file FILE to authorized_keys on all hosts,
      but also makes sure that the users ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key is in
      the file. If provided the optional user, it will add the keys to
      that user's .ssh directory. This is often required when
      adding a new user in which case HOSTS should still a sudo
      user with ssh currently enabled.

      1) adds ~/.id_rsa.pub to the FILE only if its not already in it
      2) removes all duplicated keys

      Example:
          ssh key scatter "red[01-10]"
          ssh key scatter pi@red[01-10] keys.txt --user=alice

    host key add NAMES FILE

      Adds all keys in FILE into the authorized_keys of NAMES.

      Example:
          cms host key add worker001 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    host key delete NAMES FILE

      Deletes all keys in fILE from authorized_keys of NAMES if they exist.

      Example
          cms host key delete worker001 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    host key scp NAMES FILE

      copies all keys from file FILE to authorized_keys on all hosts
      but also makes sure that the users ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key is in
      the file and removes duplicates, e.g. it calls fix before upload

      Example:
          ssh key list red[01-10] > pubkeys.txt
          ssh key scp red[01-10] pubkeys.txt

    host config NAMES IPS [--user=USER] [--key=PUBLIC]

      generates an ssh config file tempalte that can be added to your
      .ssh/config file

      Example:
          cms host config "red,red[01-03]" "198.168.1.[1-4]" --user=pi

    host check NAMES [--user=USER] [--key=PUBLIC]

      This command is used to test if you can login to the specified
      hosts. It executes the hostname command and compares it.
      It provides a table  with a sucess column

      cms host check "red,red[01-03]"

          +-------+---------+--------+
          | host  | success | stdout |
          +-------+---------+--------+
          | red   | True    | red    |
          | red01 | True    | red01  |
          | red02 | True    | red02  |
          | red03 | True    | red03  |
          +-------+---------+--------+

    host tunnel create NAMES [--port=PORT]

      This command is used to create a persistent local port
      forward on the host to permit ssh tunnelling from the wlan to
      the physical network (eth). This registers an autossh service in
      systemd with the defualt port starting at 8001.

      Example:
          cms host tunnel create red00[1-3]

    host mac NAMES

      returns the list of mac addresses of the named pis.

    host setup WORKERS [LAPTOP]

      Executes the following steps

          cms bridge create --interface='wlan0'
          cms host key create red00[1-3]
          cms host key gather red00[1-3],you@yourlaptop.local keys.txt
          cms host key scatter red00[1-3],localhost keys.txt
          rm keys.txt
          cms host tunnel create red00[1-3]

    host shutdown NAMES

      Shutsdown NAMES with `sudo shutdown -h now`. If localhost in
      names, it is shutdown last.

    host reboot NAMES

      Reboots NAMES with `sudo reboot`. If localhost in names,
      it is rebooted last.

    host adduser NAMES USER

      Adds a user with user name USER to the hosts identified by
      NAMES. Password is disabled, see host passwd to enable.

    host addsudo NAMES USER

      Adds sudo rights to USER at NAMES

    host passwd NAMES USER

      Changes the password for USER at NAMES

    host deluser NAMES USER

      Deleted USER from NAMES. Home directory will be removed.

    host config proxy PROXY NAMES

      This adds to your ~/.ssh/config file a ProxyJump
      configuration to reach NAMES via PROXY. This is useful when
      the PROXY is acting as a network bridge for NAMES to your
      current device.

      Example:
          cms host config proxy pi@red.lcaol red00[1-2]
```

### 6.4 Manual Page for the `pi` command

Note to execute the command on the command line you have to type in
`cms pi` and not just `pi`.

There is some very usefull aditional information about how to use the
LED and temperature monitoring programs at

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-pi-cluster/blob/main/README.md>

<!--MANUAL-PI-->
```
  pi led reset [NAMES]
  pi led (red|green) VALUE
  pi led (red|green) VALUE NAMES [--user=USER]
  pi led list NAMES [--user=USER]
  pi led blink (red|green) NAMES [--user=USER] [--rate=SECONDS]
  pi led sequence (red|green) NAMES [--user=USER] [--rate=SECONDS]
  pi temp NAMES [--rate=SECONDS] [--user=USER] [--output=FORMAT]
  pi free NAMES [--rate=SECONDS] [--user=USER] [--output=FORMAT]
  pi load NAMES [--rate=SECONDS] [--user=USER] [--output=FORMAT]
  pi wifi SSID [PASSWORD] [--dryrun]
  pi script list SERVICE [--details]
  pi script list SERVICE NAMES
  pi script list

Arguments:
    NAMES       The hostnames in parameterized form
    VALUE       The Values are on, off, 0, 1
    USER        The user name for a login
    SSID        The ssid of your WIfi
    PASSWORD    The assword for the WIFI

  Options:
     -v               verbose mode
     --output=OUTPUT  the format in which this list is given
                      formats includes cat, table, json, yaml,
                      dict. If cat is used, it is just print
     --user=USER      the user name
     --rate=SECONDS   repeats the quere given by the rate in seconds

Description:

      This command allows to set the leds on the PI board and return
      information about the PIs such as temperature, memory space and
      load. It also allows to set the wifi for the PI.

      The most important part of this command is that it executes it not
      only on ome pi but multiple. The hostnames are defined by a parameterized
      notation. red0[1-2] results in red01 and red02.

      The script command are not yet completed and is under development

      The script commands can be used as an alternative to shell scripts.
      They are predefined scripts that can be run easily vai the command
      The script commands are listing details. This is useful as they are
      distributed with the cloudmesh shell. Thus no additional files are
      needed.

      At this time we do not define any predefined scripts.


  Examples:

      This command switches on and off the LEDs of the specified
      PIs. If the hostname is omitted. It is assumed that the
      code is executed on a PI and its LED are set. To list the
      PIs LED status you can use the list command

      cms pi led list  "red,red[01-03]"

          lists the LED status of the given hosts

      cms pi led red off  "red,red[01-03]"

          switches off the led of the given PIs

      cms pi led red on  "red,red[01-03]"

          switches on the led of the given PIs

      cms pi led red blink  "red,red[01-03]"

          switches on and off the led of the given PIs

      cms pi led red sequence  "red,red[01-03]"

          goes in sequential order and switches on and off
          the led of the given PIs

      To showcase information about temperature free space an load
      you can ues

          pi temp "red,red[01-03]"
          pi free "red,red[01-03]"
          pi load "red,red[01-03]"

      To set the WIFI use (where SSID is your ssid). The command
      requires a reboot to activate the WIfi.

          pi wifi SSID

      The script commands are not yet implemented

          pi script list SERVICE [--details]
          pi script list SERVICE NAMES
          pi script list

```

## 7. FAQ and Hints

Here, we provide some useful FAQs and hints.

### 7.1 Quickstart for a Setup of a cluster from macOS or Linux with no burning on a PI.

This will setup the same cluster seen in [Quickstart for Bridged WiFi](#quickstart-for-bridged-wifi). Pi imager and a manual manager pi setup 
is not required using this method. It will use the latest Pi OS 
images, full for master, and lite for workers.

#### 7.1.1 Prerequisites

* We recommend Python 3.8.2 Python or newer.
* We recommend pip version 21.0.0 or newer
* You have a private and public ssh key named ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.
  ssh/id_rsa.pub
* macOS dependencies [What packages do I need to run the info command on macOS](#what-packages-do-i-need-to-run-the-info-command-on-macos)  

#### 7.1.2 Install Cloudmesh

Create a Python virtual environment `ENV3` in which to install cloudmesh. 
This will keep cloudmesh and its dependencies separate from your default 
environment. 

Always make sure to `source` this environment when working with cloudmesh.

```
you@laptop:~ $ python -m venv ~/ENV3
you@laptop:~ $ source ~/ENV3/bin/activate 
(ENV3) you@laptop:~ $ mkdir cm
(ENV3) you@laptop:~ $ cd cm
(ENV3) you@laptop:~/cm $ pip install cloudmesh-installer
(ENV3) you@laptop:~/cm $ cloudmesh-installer get pi 
```

#### 7.1.3 Create a Cluster

Here, we demonstarte how to burn 1 manager and 2 worker SD Cards. The 
manager is called red, the workers are red001 and red002.

**Step 1.** Identify the SD card device

Plug in a sd card reader with sd card to the laptop and identify the device.
In Linux it is /dev/sdX in macOS it is /dev/diskX.

```
(ENV3) you@laptop:~ $ cms burn info 
```

```

```

**Step 2.** Burn the SD cards 

You will be prompted to input your wifi password for your SSID when runing the 
command below.

```
(ENV3) you@laptop:~ $ cms burn cluster --device=/dev/diskX --hostname="red,red00[1-2]" --ssid=SSID
```

**Step 3.** Boot the cluster and complete setup of cloudmesh and all ssh 
access

Plug in the SD Cards in the PI's and start them up. It will take at least 60 
seconds for them to boot for the first time.

Now login to the manager with 

```
(ENV3) you@laptop:~ $ ssh pi@red.local
```

On the manager you call the follwoing commands

```
pi@red:~ $ curl -Ls http://cloudmesh.github.io/get/pi | sh -
pi@red:~ $ sudo reboot
(ENV3) pi@red:~ $ cms host setup red00[1-2] you@laptop.local 
```

Copy the specified command output to your ~/.ssh/config file on your laptop. 
W weill soon have a command that will add them for you without using an editor.

```
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# copy to ~/.ssh/config on remote host (i.e laptop)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Host red
     HostName red.local
     User pi

Host red001
     HostName red.local
     User pi
     Port 8001

Host red002
     HostName red.local
     User pi
     Port 8002

```

Let us test by running a command from the laptop to get the Pis' 
temperatures.

```
(ENV3) you@laptop:~ $ cms pi temp red,red00[1-2]              
pi temp red,red00[1-2]

### 7.2 Quickstart for Using a Pi to Burn a Cluster Using Inventory

In this guide, we will show how you can configure a Cloudmesh Inventory to
easily burn a cluster of SD cards as well as configure the current Pi as the
manager if desired.

We will follow the same network setup as the Bridged Wifi explained in a
previous section (see Figure 1).

The requirements for this guide are the same as the [Quickstart for Bridged WiFi](#quickstart-for-bridged-wifi).

#### 7.2.1 Initial Manager Setup

Ensure you have burned an SD card from your laptop using [Raspberry Pi
Imager](#https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/). Ensure you burn the card with
**Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit with desktop and recommended applications**. This will
serve as our manager.

Once you have burned your manager card, plug this into a Raspberry Pi. Connect
this Pi to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor and boot. Walk through the initial
setup prompt to rename your Pi's hostname to `managerpi` as well as connect to
Wifi. You should also change your password in doing so.

If you are logged in via SSH, you may accomplish the above with `sudo
raspi-config`. For more information on setups, see [Manager Pi
Setup](#32-manager-pi)

From here, we assume your Pi hostname is `managerpi`.

Once you have gone through this, you may install cloudmesh and configure your
system with the following:

```
pi@managerpi:~ $ curl -Ls http://cloudmesh.github.io/get/pi | sh -
```

Reboot after this script

```
pi@managerpi:~ $ sudo reboot
```

#### 7.2.2 Creating our inventory

For this guide, we will create two workers for `managerpi`. We can do this as
follows:

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms inventory create --manager=managerpi --workers=red00[2-3] --ip=10.1.1.1,10.1.1.[2-3]  --inventory="cluster.yaml" --keyfile=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub latest-lite
```

We can then use the following to list the entries of our inventory.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms inventory list --inventory=cluster.yaml
inventory list --inventory=cluster.yaml
+-----------+-----------+------+-------------+---------+-------+---------+----------+----------+-----+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+----------+
| host      | name      | type | tag         | cluster | label | service | services | ip       | dns | project | owners | comment | description | keyfile           | status   |
+-----------+-----------+------+-------------+---------+-------+---------+----------+----------+-----+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+----------+
| managerpi | managerpi |      | latest-lite | cluster |       | manager |          | 10.1.1.1 |     |         |        |         |             | ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | inactive |
| red002 | red002 |      | latest-lite | cluster |       | worker  |          | 10.1.1.2 |     |         |        |         |             | ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | inactive |
| red003 | red003 |      | latest-lite | cluster |       | worker  |          | 10.1.1.3 |     |         |        |         |             | ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | inactive |
+-----------+-----------+------+-------------+---------+-------+---------+----------+----------+-----+---------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------+----------+
```

#### 7.2.3 Burning SD Cards using Inventory

First, verify that you have plugged in your SD card writer with an SD card into
the `managerpi`. For this guide, we will simply use one SD card burner to burn
both SD cards.

Verify your SD card is detected with the following:

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms burn info
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# SD Cards Found
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

+----------+------------------------+-------------+------------------+--------------+------------+---------+----------+-------------+-------------+
| Path     | Info                   | Formatted   | Size             | Plugged-in   | Readable   | Empty   | Access   | Removable   | Writeable   |
|----------+------------------------+-------------+------------------+--------------+------------+---------+----------+-------------+-------------|
| /dev/sdb | Generic STORAGE DEVICE | True        | 64.1 GB/59.7 GiB | True         | True       | False   | True     | True        | True        |
+----------+------------------------+-------------+------------------+--------------+------------+---------+----------+-------------+-------------+
```
> Some information has been ommitted from cms burn info for simplicity

Note your device. In our case, it is `/dev/sdb`. Of course, on your machine it may vary. 

We can now burn our cards as follows:

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms burn create --inventory=cluster.yaml --name=managerpi,red00[2-3] --device=/dev/sdb

Manager hostname is the same as this system's hostname. Is this intended? (Y/n) Y
Do you wish to configure this system as a WiFi bridge? A restart is required after this command terminates (Y/n) Y

# Cut out output of burn command for simplicity

INFO: Burned card 1

INFO: Please remove the card

Slot /dev/sdb needs to be reused. Do you wish to continue? [y/n] y
Insert next card and press enter...

# Cut out output of burn command for simplicity

INFO: Burned card 2

INFO: Please remove the card

INFO: You burned 2 SD Cards
Done :)
```

Note that in this example, the hostname of the manager passed into `cms burn
create` is the same as the current system's hostname. This is intentnional (as
indicated by our `Y` choice) and we are also configuring the `managerpi` as a
bridge (as indicated by our `)

We must now reboot the manager.

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ sudo reboot
```

#### 7.2.4 Booting Up Workers and Verifying Connection

Insert the burned worker cards into the worker Pis and boot.

With the following command, you can verify connection to your workers:

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms pi temp red002
pi temp red002
+--------+--------+-------+----------------------------+
| host   |    cpu |   gpu | date                       |
|--------+--------+-------+----------------------------|
| red002 | 37.485 |  37.4 | 2021-02-20 00:47:19.212921 |
+--------+--------+-------+----------------------------+
```

### 7.3 Can I use the LEDs on the PI Motherboard?

Typically this LED is used to communicate some system-related
information. However `cms pi` can control it to switch status on
and off. This is helpful if you like to showcase a particular state
in the PI. Please look at the manual page. An example is
 
```bash
$ cms pi led red off HOSTNAME
```

that when executed on the PI (on which you also must have cms
installed you switch the red LED off. For more options see the
manual page


### 7.4 How can I use pycharm, to edit files or access files in general from my Laptop on the PI?

This is easily possible with the help of SSHFS. To install it we
refer you to See also: <https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs> SSHFS: add
the manager to `.ssh/config` on the local machine

Let us assume you like to edit files on a PI that you named `red`

Please create a `./.ssh/config file that contains the following:

```
 Host red
      HostName xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
      User pi
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Now let us create a directory in which we mount the remote PI directories in our 
case we mount the directory cm

```
mkdir redcm
sshfs red:/home/pi/cm  redcm -o auto_cache
```

To unmount the filesystem use on LInux

```
$ fusermount -u redcm
```

and on macOS

```
umount redcm
```

If you need other directories, pleas apply  our strategy accordingly

### 7.5 How can I enhance the `get` script?

Instead of using the link

* <http://cloudmesh.github.io/get/pi>

please use

* <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudmesh/get/main/pi>

This allows us to test also modifications to the get script before we
push them to the official community repository.

You can create a pull request at

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/get/blob/main/pi/index.html>

### 7.6 Can I use a Mesh Network for the setup?

This section is still under development.

In case you have a Mesh Network, the setup can typically be even more
simple as we can attach the unmanaged router directly to a Mesh
node via a network cable. In that case, the node is directly connected
to the internet and uses the DHCP feature from the Mesh router (see
Figure 2).

![](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-pi-burn/raw/main/images/network-mesh.png)

Figure 2: Networking with Mesh network

You will not need the bridge command to setup the network.

### 7.7 Can I use cms burn on Linux?

Not everything is supported.

To download the latest Raspberry Pi OS Lite image use

```
cms burn image get latest-lite
```

To see what SDCard writers you have attached, you can use the command

```
cms burn info
```

It will issue a probe of USB devices and see if SDCards can be found.

Identify the `/dev/sdX`, where X is a letter such as b,c,d, ... It
will likely never be sda.

To test it use

```
sudo apt-get install pv
cms burn info
cms burn sdcard --dev=/dev/sdX
cms burn mount --device=/dev/sdX
cms burn enable ssh
cms burn unmount
```

Take the SDCard into the PI and set it up there as documented.

For the full features, please use `cms burn create` instead of
`cms burn sdcard`


### 7.8 What packages do I need to run the info command on macOS

```
brew install libusb
```

**Access to ext4**: For the more advanced features of `burn` you will
need full write access to the ext4 partition on your SDCard that is
created when you burn it. Unfortunately, the tools that used to be
freely available seem no longer to work properly, so you could use
[extFS for Mac by Paragon Software](https://www.paragon-software.com/us/home/extfs-mac/)
which does cost $40 for a license.

For this reason, we recommend that you first set up the manager PI and
do all burning on the manager PI.

### 7.9 Are there any unit tests?

As `cms burn` may delete and format files and disks/SD Cards during unit
testing users are supposed to first review the tests before running
them. Please look at the source and see if you can run a test.

We have the following tests:

* `pytest -v --capture=no tests/test_01_image.py`

  * This test removes files from ~/.cloudmesh/cmburn/images
  * See also:
  [test_01_image.py](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-pi-burn/blob/main/tests/test_01_image.py)

* TODO: add the other tests

### 7.10 Using Pi Imager to setup a Manager Pi with headless access

This FAQ will provide step-by-step instructions for burning and accessing a 
headless manager pi. We include instructions for either wifi access to 
the pi or local ethernet connection.

If you have restricted WIFI that requires you to register you 
devices MAC address via a web browser (such as a campus or
hotel wifi access page), you might not be able to continue
with a headless setup. In this case, we recommend that you use your
Laptop as a "hotspot" and connect the PI to it.

This FAQ references instructions from
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/> and
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md>

**Step 1.**

Download and install the Pi Imager software from raspberrypi.org <https://www.
raspberrypi.org/software/>.

**Step 2.**

Launch the Pi Imager software, insert a SD card reader and SD card into 
your laptop.

**Step 3.**

Choose the OS in the Pi Imager interface. We will use **Raspberry Pi OS 
(32-BIT) with the Raspberry Pi desktop.

**Step 4.**

Choose the SD card in the Pi Imager interface. If you do not see an SD card 
and a reader is plugged into your laptop, remove and re-insert the sd card 
reader.

**Step 5.**

Push the 'Write' button and confirm the settings to burn the OS to your SD card.
You may need to put in the SUDO password to burn the card. This will take 
some time. USB 3.0 devices are faster than USB 2.0. Make sure your cable is 
USB 3.0 as well. 

**Step 6.**

Mount the SD card. This can be accomplished easily in Linux by unplugging 
and replugging in the device. On Pi and Linux you should see the boot 
partition at **/media/$USER/boot** (where user is you username) and on 
MacOS at **/Volumes/boot**. I will use Linux for the example. Substitute as 
required for MacOS.

**Step 7.**

Enable SSH access to the SD card. At the command prompt

```
you@yourlaptop:~ $ cd /media/$USER/boot
you@yourlaptop:~ $ touch /media/$USER/boot/ssh
```

This creates an empty file named ssh in the boot partition. On the first boot, 
this enables the SSH service, and then an empty ssh file will be 
automatically deleted.

**Step 8.**

If you only have wireless access to your Pi. You need to setup the wireless 
configuration. 

If you have restricted WIFI that requires you to register you 
devices MAC address via a web browser (think hotel wifi access page), you 
might not be able to continue with a headless setup.

Otherwise, you can continue without this step if you have ethernet
access between your laptop and pi (either via switch or direct
cable). After plugging into a shared switch with the Pi, or directly
to it, you will need to make sure you see a link local address on your
ethernet port on your laptop. It should look something
like 169.254.X.X. If you do not see this investigate how to setup a
link local ip on your OS.

```
you@yourlaptop:/media/$USER/boot $ nano /media/$USER/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf

#Insert this into the file and save (CTRL-X, Y, Enter).

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here e.g. US>

network={
 ssid="<Name of your wireless LAN>"
 psk="<Password for your wireless LAN>"
}
```

**Step 9.**

Unmount and eject the SD card. 

```
you@yourlaptop:~ $ sudo umount /media/$USER/boot
you@yourlaptop:~ $ sudo umount /media/$USER/rootfs
```

**Step 10.**

Boot a pi with the SD card. Wait a few minutes and try to access it via SSH. 
Use the Raspi OS default username "pi" and "raspberry".

```
you@yourlaptop:~ $ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

**Step 11.**

Change the password.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ passwd
```

**Step 12.**

Change the hostname on the pi.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo raspi-config
<1. System Options>
<S4 Hostname>
enter
managerpi
<Finish>
Would you like to reboot?
<Yes>
```

**Step 13.**

Wait a minute or two and reconnect. Now using the new hostname.

```
you@yourlaptop:~ $ ssh pi@managerpi.local
```

**Step 14.**

You are all done. You are ready to proceed with [Quickstart for Bridged 
WiFi](#quickstart-for-bridged-wifi). You will now witness the magic of how 
cms burn automates this process for you. 

```
pi@managerpi:~ $ 
```

### 7.11 Single Card Burning

Step 0. Ensure the SD card is inserted.

We can run `cms burn info` again as we did above to verify our 
SD card is connected.

Step 1. Burning the SD Card

Choose a hostname for your card. We will use `red001` with ip
`10.1.1.2`. The IP address `10.1.1.1` is reserved for the burner pi
(ie. `managerpi`).

> Note we are using the subnet `10.1.1.0/24` in this guide. We
> currently recommend you do the same, otherwise the WiFi bridge will
> not configure correctly. We will change this in the future to
> support other
> [Private IP Ranges](https://www.arin.net/reference/research/statistics/address_filters/)

**!! WARNING VERIFY THE DEVICE IS CORRECT. REFER TO CMS BURN !!**

```
(ENV3) pi@managerpi:~ $ cms burn create --hostname=red001 --ip=10.1.1.2 --device=/dev/sda --tag=latest-lite
```

Wait for the card to burn. Once the process is complete, it is safe 
to remove the SD card.

We can now proceed to [the bridge setup](#connecting-pis-to-the-internet-via-bridge )

### 7.12 How to update firmware?

To update the firmware reference the [raspi documentation](#https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/booteeprom.md) 

Or follow the simple instructions below.

```
pi@managerpi:~ $ sudo apt update
pi@managerpi:~ $ sudo apt full-upgrade
pi@managerpi:~ $ sudo reboot
pi@managerpi:~ $ sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a
pi@managerpi:~ $ sudo reboot
```

### 7.13 Alternatives

There are several alternatives to make the setup easier:

* Using Ansible after you have created the SDCards via PIImager. This however 
  requires still the discovery of the hosts on the network and additional steps.
* PiBakery can burn cards while allowing startup scripts and naming hosts. 
  Although the GUI is nice it is also a limiting factor as each card should have 
  a different hostname
* Using DHCP to get IP addresses automatically. This is a solution we also used but
  do not present here
* PXE or network booting which allows you to boot from the network. For larger PI 
  clusters this requires multiple Servers so that the network is not overwhelmed. 
  Starting the cluster takes much longer.

### 7.14 How do I scann for WIFI networks?

```
sudo iwlist wlan0 scan
```


### 7.15 What is the status of the implementation?

### 7.16 I run into a Kernal Panic on my burned Pi. What do I do?

Occassionally, one may run into an error similar to the following:

```
Kernel panic-not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(179,2)
```

See [here](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/40854/kernel-panic-not-syncing-vfs-unable-to-mount-root-fs-on-unknown-block179-6) for more information on this bug.

This error has been reported in the past. A simple reburn using `cms burn`
tends to resolve the issue.

### 7.17 How do I enable password login?

The option `--set_passwd` in `cms burn cluster` enables you to securely enter a
password to prevent the password disable.

The option `[--passwd=PASSWD]` is used with `cms burn create` todo the same
thing. Note entering the passwd in the command is optional.If empty you will be
prompted.

### 7.18 How do I use SDCard externers with different voltage?


Becauase I am using and sd card extender, I need to set a cmdline argument to
force 3.3V SD card operation.

You can set an arbitray command line argument with

```
cms burn set --cmdline=CMDLINE
```

To force 3.3V operation to enable the use of an SD card extender use

```
cms burn set--cmdline=sdhci.quirks2=4
```

### 7.19 How do I get the latest image if a new image was released?

From time to time raspberry.org releases new operating systems. To assure you
get the latest version, you can do the following to download the latest lite
abd full images :

```bash
$ cms burn image versions --refresh
$ cms burn image get latest-lite
$ cms burn image get latest-full
```

To safe space you can also delete the old versions. Look at the storage
location where we place the images with

```bash
$ ls -1 ~/.cloudmesh/cmburn/images
```

YOu can delete the ones that do not have the lates date. Such as 

```bash
$ rm  ~/.cloudmesh/cmburn/images/2021-01-11-raspio*
```

If you see any images with the date 2021-01-11 and so on.
